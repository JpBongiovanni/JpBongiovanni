### Hello! I'm Jason ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software developer with over 10 years in international education. I completed Coding Dojo's full stack python course in February 2021, and since then I have been creating full stack python projects, and teaching myself React.Js. Below are a few projects I'm working on. If you'd like to view them on a separate page, [click here to visit my personal website.](https://jb-portfolio.vercel.app/)
