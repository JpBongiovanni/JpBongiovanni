### Hello! I'm Jason ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software developer with over 10 years in international education. I completed Coding Dojo's full stack python course in February 2021, and since then I have been creating full stack python projects, and teaching myself React.Js. Below are a few projects I'm working on. If you'd like to view them on a separate page, [click here to visit my personal website.](https://jb-portfolio.vercel.app/)

### Gaming News API / Web scrapper:
The Gaming News API was created utilizing Express, Axios, and Cheerio. The API scrapes the webpages of various gaming news sites for a specific game franchise, and then returns the newest headlines for your favorite video games. Click the links below to view the code, or visit rapidapi.com to test endpoints, and copy code snippets to utilize the API for your own project.

#### Rapid API Instructions:
After clicking the link to Rapid API, you can subscribe to the API to get a number of free end point tests. Select a GET endpoint on the left side of the screen, and then click the blue "Test Endpoint" button to run the we web scrapper and see results.
